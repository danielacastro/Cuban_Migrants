<p> Cuban Migration to the United States increased 78 percent between 2014 and 2015. </p>

<p>Last year, around 8,000 Cubans left the country trying to reach U.S soil, fearing that the policies that have benefited them so far were shut down, following the normalization of the U.S-Cuba relations last year. </p>

<p>While many cheered the normalization of the US-Cuba relations, it also pushed many Cubans to set out on the long and risky journey from Cuba to the U.S. through South and Central America.</p>

<p> In November 2015, Nicaragua closed its border with Costa Rica to Cuban migrants trying to pass through the country. The incident soon turned into a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of Cubans stuck in Pe&ntildeas Blancas, Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Nicaragua claimed that the country didn't have the resources to face the new threat to its national security.</p>  

<p>"The Government of Nicaragua ratifies its stance on not legitimate illegal policies that cause harm, suffering and economic looses to human beings, families, governments, and people in Cuba and the region," stated the ambassador of Nicaragua Hernan Estada Roman. </p>

<p> Guatemala and Belize also refused the passage of the migrants through their countries. </p>

<p> As a result of the humanitarian crisis in Costa Rica, Ecuador started to request tourist visas for Cubans and Costa Rica stopped issuing special transit visas to Cubans in December, in a move to curb the flow of Cuban migrants en route to the U.S.</p>

<p> Cubans migrants waited for months for a solution in shelters, temporary tents and family houses in Costa Rica, with little money in their pockets. Others decided to continue their journey with the help of coyotes, risking their lives and facing the possibility of being caught by the Nicaraguan authorities and sent back to Costa Rica, or even face deportation.</p>

<p> Under an agreement reached early this year between Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United Nations International Organization for Migration (OIM), Cubans with transit visas in Costa Rica were allowed to buy "packages" and continue their journey through El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.</p>

<p>However, while the solution of the current crisis in Costa Rica seems to be on the right track, the migration from the Caribbean island seems to advance steadily.</p>

<p> Earlier this month, 60 Cubans where detained in Honduras. 10 more were detained in Colombia, who, according to the authorities, entered to La Guajira from Venezuela, then went to Barranquilla, Monteria and Turbo, where they would take a boat to Central America.</p>

       <p>The existing federal law treats all Cubans arrivals as refugees or political asylees.</p> 

       <p>Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, Cubans can stay in the country and apply for permanent residence after one year. The 1995 "wet foot, dry foot" policy, which stems from the Act, allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to apply for citizenship.</p>
 
       <p>However, the Cubans who are apprehended in the water between the two countries are considered "wet foot" and are sent back to Cuba.</p>
 
       <p>The policy was first intended to prevent a massive exodus of refugees, but based on the recent statistics, it has not discourage Cubans from leaving their country.</p>

   <p> Even thought the U.S government has said that the Cuban Adjustment Act will still be in place, it is not yet clear what will happen with the law in the future, with some politicians arguing that the policy is outdated and is not fair, compared to the treatment Central American immigrants have received, who usually face deportation.</p>

<p>In December 2015, Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo "published legislation to stop automatically granting Cubans in the U.S. welfare benefits that take most immigrants of other nationalities years to obtain," according to the Miami Herald.</p>
